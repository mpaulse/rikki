Rikki
======================================================

Rikki is a Japanese-to-English dictionary application for Windows that allows
you to lookup Japanese words and kanji by hovering your mouse over any Japanese
text. It works similar to the popular Rikaichan/Rikaikun/Rikaichamp browser
extensions for Chrome and Firefox, but works for any Japanese text shown by any
application on the screen, including images. Dictionary lookups are performed
using the [Kanjitomo](https://github.com/sakarika/kanjitomo-ocr) OCR (optical
character recognition) engine.

*This project is still in active development. No releases have been made.*
